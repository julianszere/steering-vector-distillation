## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/agu18dec/steering-vector-distillation.git
cd steering-vector-distillation
bash install.sh
huggingface-cli login   # or: export HF_TOKEN=...
wandb login             # or: export WANDB_API_KEY=...
sl-fetch                # pulls v_teacher / v_student vectors from the HF repo above
```

`sl-fetch download_data=True` also downloads the pre-generated steered SL
datasets, so you can skip `sl-gen-steered` + `sl-filter`.

## Basic subliminal learning

Generate the steered teacher data, filter it, LoRA-SFT the student, then
measure cat-rate on the 50-prompt animal-preference eval:

```
sl-gen
sl-filter
sl-train
sl-eval adapter_path=checkpoints/cat_qwen25_7b_r8_a32_adamw_e10_lr1e-4_s1_v1 \
        run_name=cat_qwen25_7b_eval_s1
```

## v_student — sufficiency and necessity

Extract `v_student` from a trained student adapter, then test it at
inference time on the base model (sufficiency: adding it should *raise*
cat-rate) and on the student itself (necessity: replacing the student's
hidden state with the base's should *drop* cat-rate).

```
sl-extract-student adapter_path=checkpoints/cat_qwen25_7b_r8_a32_adamw_e10_lr1e-4_s1_v1

# Sufficiency: add v_student to the BASE model.
sl-eval-steered

# Necessity: replace the student's residual stream with the base's along v_student.
sl-eval-steered mode=replace_base alpha=1 \
                adapter_path=checkpoints/cat_qwen25_7b_r8_a32_adamw_e10_lr1e-4_s1_v1 \
                run_name=v_student_nec_qwen_cat_s1
```

## v_teacher — sufficiency and necessity

Extract `v_teacher` from the base model, then run the full
gen → filter → train → eval chain for each condition. Sufficiency steers
the teacher with `v_teacher` while generating data (no cat system prompt);
necessity uses the cat system prompt but projects `v_teacher` out of the
residual stream during generation.

```
sl-extract-teacher

# Sufficiency: add v_teacher during steered generation, then SL-train + eval.
sl-gen-steered
sl-filter run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_suff_L23_a3_prefill_s42
sl-train  dataset_run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_suff_L23_a3_prefill_s42 \
          run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_suff_train_s1

          run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_suff_eval_s1

# Necessity: keep the cat sys prompt but project v_teacher out during generation.

               run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_nec_L20_tiled_a1_s42

sl-train  dataset_run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_nec_L20_tiled_a1_s42 \
          run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_nec_train_s1
sl-eval   adapter_path=checkpoints/cat_qwen25_v_teacher_nec_train_s1 \
          run_name=cat_qwen25_v_teacher_nec_eval_s1

## Screen arbitrary concepts for transfer

[`notebooks/figure5_concept_transfer.ipynb`](notebooks/figure5_concept_transfer.ipynb)
generalizes the Figure 5a steering screen to lists of animals or trees with
`allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct`. Vector extraction uses paired system/no-system
activations on 1,024 diverse semantic instructions rather than number-sequence
prompts; the layer/alpha sweep and positive/negative/off-topic specificity gate
otherwise follow the repository's zoo experiment.

```bash
uv sync
uv run --with jupyterlab jupyter lab notebooks/figure5_concept_transfer.ipynb
```

```python
from subliminal.transfer_predictor import ANIMALS, TransferPredictor, predict_transfer

predictor = TransferPredictor()  # lazy: loads OLMo-2 on the first uncached call
predictions = predict_transfer(ANIMALS, domain="animals", predictor=predictor)
predictions
```

The returned `clean_peak_pos_rate` is the continuous Figure-5-style score.
Figure 5a established the one-sided result that traits with zero steering failed
to transfer, but did not provide a calibrated success cutoff.
`passes_zero_steering_screen` preserves that paper-style absolute-rate test;
`steering_effect_detected` additionally checks that steering improved on the
unsteered baseline. By default, a positive clean rate with positive lift is
`not_ruled_out` and leaves `predicted_transfer=None`; zero steering or no lift is
`unlikely`. A binary added heuristic requires an explicit `transfer_threshold`.
No student is trained by this screen, and OLMo-2, semantic extraction probes,
and trees are extrapolations beyond the paper's validation.
